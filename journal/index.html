<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> <br>
I’m super excited for this trip! We aren’t stopping anywhere today, but we got on a plane bound for Peru this afternoon. I’ve never been there, and I can’t wait to check another country off my list. We have a lot of plane rides in the next week, so I just started a super long series so I could read it on the plane. We left Seattle at about 3 pm, then stopped at Portland, then a flight from Portland to LA. Tonight, we leave LA on a red-eye flight to Lima. 
I guess I didn’t need to read my book today because there were a ton of great movies on the flights. (it was Alaska so duh) I also got to know one of my fellow competitors- we watched Legally Blonde together on the flight from Seattle to Portland. Elle Woods is a total icon. We had a snack in PDX- dry bagels aren’t exactly my favorite, and neither is the gross watery cream cheese, but better than airplane food. 
I watched Interstellar on the way to LA and my mind is still melted. That movie, like, seems like it isn’t making sense but you keep watching and then you realize that it all made sense but in a way that didn’t make sense. So, next I watched Mary Poppins Returns to calm my brain down. It was good, but I’m definitely not in the target age range. I still love Lin-Manuel Miranda, though!
We went to a sit down restaurant in the airport at LAX for dinner. I mean, when you’re at the airport, why go to a sit down restaurant? But, the food was pretty good so I was ok with it. 
I’m kinda nervous for tomorrow’s flight, because it’s on this airline that I’ve never heard of, LATAM. I mean, it shouldn’t matter, cause I’m just going to sleep the whole time, but still. That’s it for today.
