<h1> Here's one of our contestants' daily Travel Journal! </h1>
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> <br>
I’m super excited for this trip! We aren’t stopping anywhere today, but we got on a plane bound for Peru this afternoon. I’ve never been there, and I can’t wait to check another country off my list. We have a lot of plane rides in the next week, so I just started a super long series so I could read it on the plane. We left Seattle at about 3 pm, then stopped at Portland, then a flight from Portland to LA. Tonight, we leave LA on a red-eye flight to Lima.<br>
I guess I didn’t need to read my book today because there were a ton of great movies on the flights. (it was Alaska so duh) I also got to know one of my fellow competitors- we watched Legally Blonde together on the flight from Seattle to Portland. Elle Woods is a total icon. We had a snack in PDX- dry bagels aren’t exactly my favorite, and neither is the gross watery cream cheese, but better than airplane food. <br>
I watched Interstellar on the way to LA and my mind is still melted. That movie, like, seems like it isn’t making sense but you keep watching and then you realize that it all made sense but in a way that didn’t make sense. So, next I watched Mary Poppins Returns to calm my brain down. It was good, but I’m definitely not in the target age range. I still love Lin-Manuel Miranda, though!<br>
We went to a sit down restaurant in the airport at LAX for dinner. I mean, when you’re at the airport, why go to a sit down restaurant? But, the food was pretty good so I was ok with it. <br>
I’m kinda nervous for tomorrow’s flight, because it’s on this airline that I’ve never heard of, LATAM. I mean, it shouldn’t matter, cause I’m just going to sleep the whole time, but still. That’s it for today.

<p><strong>Day 2:</strong><br>
Ok, so the plane wasn’t that bad. I had, like, a solid 10 hours of sleep- that’s way more than I usually get! We woke up to the complimentary hotel breakfast. I’m used to the regular continental kind, where you make your own pancakes and eat peach yogurt. Here, there were what looked like tamales but they had no meat, and deep-fried sweet potato. I had the chance to drink papaya juice, and it was so good- none of the acidity of citrus, but all the sweetness! <br>
Today’s detour was shearing an alpaca. What’s the difference between a llama and an alpaca? Does anyone know? We had to drive like a bit to this alpaca farm, but it was still in the city so it wasn’t a real alpaca farm, more of a tourist thing. Shearing those is a lot of work! I’m really glad we only had to do one alpaca, or I would have died. There was a handler whose job was to hold the alpaca’s head while it was STRAPPED TO THE GROUND OMG THAT WAS SCARY AHHHHHHHH but the handler guy was telling us what to do so it was okay, I guess. For the first half, I had to cut the fleece from the alpaca and I was super freaked out cause I thought I might cut the alpaca. It was fine, though, and halfway through, my partner and I switched. <br>Then, I had to scoop the cut fleece and put them on this special table. By the end, the alpaca had been reduced to half its former glory, but it was still super cute. We then had to sort the fleece based on dirtiness, and that was a lot of work. It was really soft, though, and I’m going to buy like 5 scarves made of this stuff now. <br>
We had a pretty late lunch. I got to try the pretty infamous cuy, or guinea pig. Super greasy, but tastes like chicken- I definitely wouldn’t try it again. After lunch, we drove around downtown Lima- the Plaza Mayor and the cathedral were pretty, we took a couple photos for the ‘gram. Then, we headed to the airport, after a light dinner. I had these potatoes stuffed with meat, papas rellenos, and French fries kinda suck now. I’m tired now. </p>
