<h1> Here's one of our contestants' daily Travel Journal! </h1>
<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> <br>
I’m super excited for this trip! We aren’t stopping anywhere today, but we got on a plane bound for Peru this afternoon. I’ve never been there, and I can’t wait to check another country off my list. We have a lot of plane rides in the next week, so I just started a super long series so I could read it on the plane. We left Seattle at about 3 pm, then stopped at Portland, then a flight from Portland to LA. Tonight, we leave LA on a red-eye flight to Lima.<br>
I guess I didn’t need to read my book today because there were a ton of great movies on the flights. (it was Alaska so duh) I also got to know one of my fellow competitors- we watched Legally Blonde together on the flight from Seattle to Portland. Elle Woods is a total icon. We had a snack in PDX- dry bagels aren’t exactly my favorite, and neither is the gross watery cream cheese, but better than airplane food. <br>
I watched Interstellar on the way to LA and my mind is still melted. That movie, like, seems like it isn’t making sense but you keep watching and then you realize that it all made sense but in a way that didn’t make sense. So, next I watched Mary Poppins Returns to calm my brain down. It was good, but I’m definitely not in the target age range. I still love Lin-Manuel Miranda, though!<br>
We went to a sit down restaurant in the airport at LAX for dinner. I mean, when you’re at the airport, why go to a sit down restaurant? But, the food was pretty good so I was ok with it. <br>
I’m kinda nervous for tomorrow’s flight, because it’s on this airline that I’ve never heard of, LATAM. I mean, it shouldn’t matter, cause I’m just going to sleep the whole time, but still. That’s it for today. 
</p>

<p><strong>Day 2:</strong><br>
Ok, so the plane wasn’t that bad. I had, like, a solid 10 hours of sleep- that’s way more than I usually get! We woke up to an airport breakfast. I’m used to the regular continental kind, where you make your own pancakes and eat peach yogurt. Here, there were what looked like tamales but they had no meat, and deep-fried sweet potato. I had the chance to drink papaya juice, and it was so good- none of the acidity of citrus, but all the sweetness! <br>
Today’s detour was shearing an alpaca. What’s the difference between a llama and an alpaca? Does anyone know? We had to drive like a bit to this alpaca farm, but it was still in the city so it wasn’t a real alpaca farm, more of a tourist thing. Shearing those is a lot of work! I’m really glad we only had to do one alpaca, or I would have died. There was a handler whose job was to hold the alpaca’s head while it was STRAPPED TO THE GROUND OMG THAT WAS SCARY AHHHHHHHH but the handler guy was telling us what to do so it was okay, I guess. For the first half, I had to cut the fleece from the alpaca and I was super freaked out cause I thought I might cut the alpaca. It was fine, though, and halfway through, my partner and I switched. <br>Then, I had to scoop the cut fleece and put them on this special table. By the end, the alpaca had been reduced to half its former glory, but it was still super cute. We then had to sort the fleece based on dirtiness, and that was a lot of work. It was really soft, though, and I’m going to buy like 5 scarves made of this stuff now. <br>
We had a pretty late lunch. I got to try the pretty infamous cuy, or guinea pig. Super greasy, but tastes like chicken- I definitely wouldn’t try it again. Then, we headed to the airport, after a light dinner. I had these potatoes stuffed with meat, papas rellenos, and French fries kinda suck now. I’m tired now. </p>

<p><strong>Day 3:</strong><br>
We’re in Italy!! I can’t wait to eat so much food that I have to spend the entire flight in the small airplane bathrooms. Today, our first order of business was to get on a train to Milan. Trenitalia is basically Italy’s beefed up version of Amtrak. I had like 2 different coffees on that train, and that was my whole breakfast. Like, where else do you get absolutely stellar cappuccinos and lattes on public transportation!! 
And then, we arrive at today’s detour challenge: HELP DESIGN THINGS FOR PRADA! YES, THAT PRADA!<br>
Driving around Milan was awesome- the central part of the city was so pretty and luxurious. Sometimes we'd see one of those designer stores and they were huge. Nothing like the strip mall back home. Europe is so weird, there was like zero trash anywhere. America, by comparison, is like 200% trash and you'd have to look for the stores under it. We pulled up to Prada, and we see all these handbags that are like €2000000000000000000000 (or in my head, that's how many zeroes there were [does anyone know the euro to US dollar conversion rate?]) We met this nice lady that was living proof that Italians do talk with their hands, and she led us to the part that says Employees Only. Last time I went through one of those doors was when I worked at Abercrombie in high school. Yes, it is just as dark in there as the actual store.<br>
Designing clothes is actually crazy hard work. It’s not just think of a shirt and it appears. You have to think of everything, like the fit, and the type of fabric, and the way it’s sewed, and oof. I also learned I have little to no taste when it comes to haute couture. They all look the same to me??<br>
Fortunately, my partner is good at this. She created this awesome handbag that had looked awesome. I helped with the inside, though- it holds an INSANE amount of things. Seriously, it’s like Hermione’s extension-charmed bag in Harry Potter. I’d totally buy my bag. <br>
Ok, lunch break!! We had traditional Milanese food. Apparently Milan is in a region called Lombardy (i thought lombardy was the superbowl trophy dude??), and a classic Lombardy dish is this pumpkin ravioli. OMG. Like wow. My experience with ravioli is the spinach stuff from Costco and then Olive Garden if I really want to. But like the pumpkin was the best kind of sweet, without being overpowering, and the pasta was the perfect soft-hard mix. No special sauce, either, just this butter lightly flavored with sage. It left just the right amount of nuttiness to the ravioli. One day, I’ll come back here and just eat. Nothing else. <br>
Now, it was voting time. It wasn’t just the contestants who were voting, but also some real Prada fashion designers were there, and I totally wanted to impress them.  You couldn’t vote for yourself, which kinda sucked… I hate when they do that, but I guess it makes sense. This other team came up with this cool geometric sort of wallet that had room for like 20 cards, and I have no idea why I’d be carrying around 20 cards, but I voted for that. The results came through, and we were… tied for first with that cursed wallet! They called for a revote, and thank God. We won by a single vote. A. Single. Vote. It was awesome! Prada said they might even incorporate some of our design into a new handbag, and we’d get them for a discounted price! Granted, I probably couldn’t even afford the discounted price, but the fact that part of my design will be under some other rich person’s armpit is awesome. <br>
We had train dinner, just like train breakfast. I went with a standard fettuccine alfredo, but by no means was it just standard. It was great. Today was great. I’m feeling great. Oof, turbulence- I’ll stop writing now…</p>

<p><strong>Day 4:</strong><br>
Our entire morning was spent on the plane. I'm slowly losing track of time. I wake up and I can't tell if its morning. Jetlag has become all consuming. We got off the plane at 2:30 pm local time (I'm told we're in India now) but it feels like the morning cause the plane ride is just one long night. Stepping out of the airport, my skin shriveled and died. I forgot to put on my sunscreen. They said it was the monsoon? It's like way above 90°? No clouds anywhere?<br>
All my Indian friends said I HAD to try the street food, so that's what we decided to have for lunch. Wow, was it spicy. Like, my-eyes-were-tearing-up levels of spice. It reminded me of that one time where I accidentally dipped my tortilla chip in the habanero salsa and oof. But the food was actually pretty good. It was pretty flavorful after we asked the guy to reduce the spice. I'm going go have to go find some good samosas back home.<br>
We’re going to one of the world’s largest slums- it’s called Dharavi. Now, I’ve never really seen a slum before- The U.S. may have some really poor areas, but there aren’t real slums, the kind where hundreds of thousands of people live in a super small area. So this was new for me. The task seemed easy enough- get some water, buy some vegetables, use the bathroom if necessary, pretty ordinary, everyday things. <br>
Wow, were people’s everyday different here. We had to stand in a line in the blazing sun to fill up this bucket from the communal water pump. It was pretty crazy that these people have never had the luxury of just waking up and turning on the tap to brush their teeth. The vegetable market was different, too. I’ve been to plenty of farmer’s markets. But here, it was as if everyone knew each other- there was a sort of camaraderie that you probably can’t find anywhere else. And people actually bargain here! Like, the person in front of me got a significantly better price than me. And I don’t even want to talk about the bathrooms. Ever been to the park where they only have porta-potties? Imagine that, but that’s all they have anywhere, for everyone on the block. I’m a culprit of using my phone on the toilet- there’s no time to do that here, cause there’s always someone behind you. Overall, this detour was eye-opening and really humbling. <br>
We went to eat dinner, which was thankfully not as spicy as lunch. Now we’re on the plane, heading to Cambodia. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Day 5:</strong><br>
Tonight’s the first (and only) night we’re staying at a hotel! I’m pretty hyped. A comforter, pillows, and a mattress sounds like the best thing ever. So, we’re in Cambodia, a country I know little to nothing about. I mean, we’re somewhere around Vietnam, right? (ok i’m right, thank god)
We’re in this town called Siem Reap, and there’s a bunch of old temples around here. We’re going to one today, called Angkor Wat. Apparently it’s the biggest Hindu temple in the world. (I thought this area was Buddhist??)<br>
Ok, I am absolutely floored by how pretty it is. It’s huge! There are all of these round towers that come up and it’s so intricate. We have to do a scavenger hunt, and all the items are related to the history of Cambodia. Maybe I’ll become an expert on Cambodia by the end of this!<br>
I’ve done my share of scavenger hunts, and I’ll admit- this one was hard, even for me. My team still won, by a long shot, but it was still hard. I was right, though- I definitely did learn a lot. Cambodia was historically ruled by the Khmer Empire- which was like Cambodia’s golden age. Then the French occupied, and then Cambodia spiralled downward… they had a civil war and a genocide and they still haven’t really recovered from that. I have yet to see the rest of Cambodia, but the opulence of Angkor Wat is only a remnant. <br>
We flew back to Phnom Penh and here comes the part I’m most excited for- the hotel! We stayed at one called the Pavilion. It was constructed from 4 1920’s era French-Cambodian villas, and you can definitely tell. I spent a long time in the pool before taking a real shower and settling into bed. God, I miss showers. </p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Day 6:</strong><br>
Funny. We had a layover in Bangkok while flying from Mumbai to Phnom Penh, but our layover from Phnom Penh to Auckland is… also in Bangkok. It was a weird sense of familiarity. <br>
Anyway, Auckland?? New Zealand was never on my bucket list. All I’ve heard of are its sheep and its hobbits. So, when I heard we’re playing cricket, I let out an audible groan. I’d rather see the hobbits. Isn’t cricket just stupid baseball? And baseball is already really, really stupid. <br>
Eden Park is like any other stadium. But it was totally empty. Kinda pissed that no one showed up to watch us play stupider baseball?? The teams were randomly assigned. We got this dude named Kane Williamson and the other team was super mad. Who’s this Kane dude? What kind of a name is Kane?? He should’ve taken inspiration from this other guy on our team- Colin de Grandhomme. Now that’s a name. I don’t remember anyone else right now, I’m sorry. <br>
It took me a long time to understand the rules- so the scoring was basically the same as baseball, but getting out was a totally different ordeal. If something happens to touch these stick thingies called wickets that are behind you (you’re a batsman [i think that means you have a bat]) you’re out. No three strikes. I was pretty okay at batting, so I was put I think fourth or fifth in our lineup. We were playing this style of cricket, called Twenty20, with only 20 overs and an over is 6 balls. Why can’t they just say 120 balls? Idk, don’t ask me. Our team bated first, and I got 25 runs! 25 whole runs!!!!! That’s crazy good, Kane tells me- especially for my first time! What can I say, I’m a god. Now comes the bowling- which has nothing to do with bowls. It’s where your team is either throwing or catching the ball. I couldn’t bowl for crap, so I was fielding (catching! use normal english pls!). The positions had crazy names, like cow corner or silly point. I was put at deep cover, so like left field if the batting dude is right handed. I caught like 2 balls, but it was actually really fun!<br>
It was really fun cause we won. No question about it. The other team said the Kane dude carried us, but if anyone’s asking, I think my 25 runs really helped our effort. For dinner, we had local New Zealand food. I had a sea urchin! Whoa! Then, to celebrate the end of our Amazing Race, we had a special New Zealand ice cream delicacy. They called it hokey pokey ice cream, I called it heaven. Same difference. Vanilla with honeycomb toffee. I have no idea why toffee hasn’t caught on in America, because it is the best crap ever. I had three scoops. No regrets.</p>

<p><strong>Day 7:</strong><br>
This is the last leg of our great adventure. A full day on just a plane. How anticlimactic. And get this: our layover is in Honolulu, Hawai’i! HAWAI’I!!! And we can’t even get off! That’s just depressing.<br>
This trip was way more than a once-in-a-lifetime experience. I’m never ever going to forget it. I’m almost a different person. Like, I appreciate fashion and cricket now! That’s crazy! But I’ve also learned that you really don’t understand something until you actually do it. People around the world work so hard, in different ways, and I’ve grown to appreciate that. <br>
Ok, the flight attendant is offering me those Biscoff cookies you can only get on flights. That’s my cue to stop writing. There’s only two cookies in here? I need at least 15 to be reasonably satisfied. Ugh.</p>
